                The <strong>Georgetown Car Barn</strong>is a historic building in the <a href="#">Georgetown
                    neighborhood</a> of
                <a href="#">Washington, D.C.,</a>in the United States. Designed by the architect<a href="#">Waddy Butler
                    Wood,</a>it was built between 1895 and 1897 by the<a href="#"> Capital Traction Company</a>as a
                union
                terminal for several Washington and Virginia streetcar lines. The adjacent Exorcist steps, later named
                after
                their appearance in William Friedkin's 1973 horror film The Exorcist, were built during the initial
                construction
                to connect M Street with Prospect Street.
            </p>
            <p>
                Intended for dual use as a passenger station and as a storage house for the streetcars, the Car Barn
                began
                Washington's only cable car system. Almost immediately after the building opened, the system was
                electrified
                and
                the Car Barn was converted to accommodate electric streetcars. Throughout its history as a terminal and
                storage
                facility, the Car Barn was never utilized to the extent anticipated by its construction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The building has undergone several renovations, the most extensive in 1911, when the original Romanesque
                Revival
                façade was significantly modified and the interior was almost completely gutted. Not long after its
                opening,
                the
                building fell into disrepair. Changing ownership over time, it maintained its original function of
                housing
                streetcars until 1950, when it was redeveloped as office space. Among its occupants was the
                International
                Police
                Academy, an arm of the <a href="#">Central Intelligence Agency</a> which operated out of the Car Barn in
                the
                1960s and 1970s.
                Today, it is used as an academic building by <a href="#">Georgetown University</a>

                <p>The Car Barn's original foundation supported a <a href="#">warehouse</a> constructed in 1761[1] to
                    store
                    <a href="#">tobacco</a> for auction unloaded from ships docked at the location of the present-day
                    Key
                    Bridge. The warehouse was
                    converted to keep horses and their trolleys around 1861. On August 23, 1894, Congress authorized the
                    extension of an existing trolley line terminating at the intersection of Bridge and High Streets
                    (now
                    Wisconsin Avenue and M Street respectively) to the intersection of M and 36th Streets. With the
                    authorization, Congress required that a union station be erected at the site.[2] Thereafter, the
                    site
                    was used to store horse-drawn trolley cars.[3]</p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Construction on the building then known as Union Station began in early 1895 under the architectural
                direction of Waddy Butler Wood.[2] The superintendent and chief engineer of the Capital Traction
                Company, D.S. Carll, was in charge of the construction.[4] Before construction of the Car Barn, the two
                streets were joined by a steep hillside that carried 36th Street.[5] Large amounts of earth were
                excavated—80,000 cubic yards (61,000 m3) in total—resulting in the sharp cliff that exists today.
                Adjacent to the Car Barn are a set of stairs commonly known as the Exorcist steps and a large retaining
                wall, which were built at the time the Car Barn was constructed, to connect M and Prospect Streets.[6]
                The steps are so named as they provided the location for the scene in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist
                where the priest is thrown down
            </p>
            <p>
                The building's construction was opposed by the next-door resident of the Prospect House, who furnished
                affidavits by prominent architects stating that blasting from the construction was damaging her house;
                this
                led to court-ordered supervision of the blasting in 1894.[8] After the Car Barn's construction, the
                large
                edifice obstructed the view of the Potomac River and Virginia from homes on Prospect Street, including
                the
                well-known cottage of E. D. E. N. Southworth.[a] For this reason, some considered it a "desecration" of
                the
                local scenery.[9]
            </p>
            <p>
                The three-story, 180-by-242-foot (55 by 74 m) building was opened on May 27, 1897, containing offices
                for
                the several tenant trolley companies and waiting rooms that were decorated with red oak wainscot
                panelling,
                ornate iron stair railings, and stuccoed ceilings. The exterior was designed in the Romanesque Revival
                style.[10] Its tower, which reached a height of 140 feet (43 m), contained an elevator that shuttled
                passengers between the terminals.[2] Many of the building's decorations reflect its original function.
                The
                pediment facing M Street reads "Capital Traction Company" and contains three decorative flywheels.[11]
            </p>
            <p>
                The M Street-facing first floor served the Washington and Georgetown Railroad. The second and third
                floors
                were connected with steel trestles to allow for trolleys coming across the Potomac River from Rosslyn,
                which
                served Washington, Arlington, Falls Church, and were projected to serve the Great Falls and Old Dominion
                Railroad. The roof, which was level with Prospect Street, was used by the Metropolitan Railroad and had
                a
                covered walkway for passengers to get from the elevator to Prospect street.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
                The station operated as Washington's only cable car trolley terminal for less than a year.[2] Almost
                immediately after opening, the Car Barn was converted to operate the new electric streetcars.[11] The
                Virginia lines never made use of the terminal and the Metropolitan Railroad did not use the station to
                the
                extent intended. It intended to place storage tracks on the roof of the building, but never did.[2]

            <p>
                Although regarded as well-designed before 1900, the Car Barn thereafter began a period of deterioration
                and
                neglect lasting for 50 years.[2] The first stage of the transition from a trolley station to an office
                building was carried out between 1906 and 1908, when portions of the second floor were converted into
                office
                space. The electrification of streetcars necessitated a large-scale re-design of the Barn, which began
                in
                1910. To accommodate the larger cars, the entrances to the building were extended and a new elevator was
                installed to lift streetcars to the roof.[12] This transition required a near complete reconstruction of
                the
                building. The steel support beams were replaced and the entire façade was changed to extend toward M
                Street
                and increase its height to allow more office space. These modifications were complete in 1911.[13]
            </p>
            <p>
                Further conversions of track space to office space occurred between 1921 and 1922. Extensive remodeling
                occurred again in 1933 with the designation of the Car Barn as the headquarters of the new Capital
                Transit
                Company, as a result of the mergn the Capital Traction Company and the Washington Railway and
                Electric Company, which increased the number of office workers at the building. These changes involved
                the
                removal of the roof in thof the building, the creation of a lightwell on the third floor, the
                conversion of the third floor into office space, and the removal of the covered passageway on the
                roof.[13]

                The last streetcar operations at the Car Barn ended with the closure of the Rosslyn–Benning Line on
                April
                30, 1949. The building continued to store streetcars until May 1950. Toward the end of 1952, the first
                floor
                was converted into office space.[13]
            </p>
            <p>
                When the Capital Transit Company merged with its competitors, the building came under the ownership of
                its
                new corporate successor, the DC Transit System, in 1956. By then, the building had fallen into such a
                state
                of disrepair that the company deliberated over whether to demolish it entirely. Seeking to preserve the
                historic structure, it elected to redevelop it.[2] The building underwent considerable interior
                renovations
                between 1957 and 1960, which were intended to turn the structure entirely into an office building. This
                involved lowering the ceilings, which were previously designed to accommodate the height of the
                streetcars.[13] The building was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1967.[14]
            </p>
            <p>
                By 1963,[15] the Car Barn was home to the International Police Academy, operated by the Central
                Intelligence
                Agency (though officially part of the Agency for International Development) that trained Latin American
                police forces; members of these forces met at the Car Barn until the program was shut down in 1975.[16]
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1992, the owner of the DC Transit System, O. Roy Chalk, was subject to foreclosure, and the building
                came
                under the ownership of the Lutheran Brotherhood.[17] The Car Barn was purchased by Douglas Development
                Corporation in 1997—which continues to own the building—and it was renovated the following year. The
                primary
                tenant is Georgetown University,[18] which first began leasing space in the 1950s.[19] After two years
                of
                renovation by the university that ended in 2017, the first floor was converted from a garage to house
                the
                Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Georgetown University Press.[20] The building today has
                four
                floors and has a floor area of 81,765 square feet (7,596.2 m2).[18]
